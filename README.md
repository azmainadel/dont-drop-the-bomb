This microcontroller project is a multiplayer game called *Don’t Drop The Bomb*.

As it is a game, our goal is to provide entertainment using the wonderful mechanisms of microcontrollers.

The game features two bars on two opposite edges of some connected dot matrices which the players control. The control will be done by gyroscopic sensing. 
A bomb aka a dot will move from one side to the another. Players have to defend themselves by hitting the bomb with their bars. 
They’ll also try to make the opponent miss the bomb.
If the bomb misses the bar and falls off the edge, a point is scored by the opponent and the player dies (temporarily of course).
The death will be remembered by a buzzer connected to our system. The death count will be shown in real time in a LCD.

The player who’s able to collect 5 kills first, wins the round.
